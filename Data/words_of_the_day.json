All Saints' Day is also a time for remembering loved ones who have passed away. In some cultures, families visit cemeteries to pay their respects to the deceased, often by cleaning and decorating graves. All Saints' Day is closely connected to Halloween, with 'Halloween' being a contraction of 'All Hallows' Eve' (the evening before All Saints' Day). While Halloween has taken on a more secular and commercial aspect, All Saints' Day remains a religious observance."

    "holiday_desc": "Also known as Bonfire Night, is a British observance held on November 5th. The holiday is named after Guy Fawkes, one of the key figures in the Gunpowder Plot. In 1605, Fawkes and a group of Catholic conspirators attempted to assassinate King James I and his government, as they were seen as oppressive to Catholics. The conspirators smuggled barrels of gunpowder into the cellars beneath the House of Lords with the intention of detonating them during the State Opening of Parliament. The plot was foiled when an anonymous letter alerted authorities to the conspiracy. Guy Fawkes was discovered guarding the gunpowder and arrested. He was subsequently tortured and revealed the names of his fellow conspirators. In the aftermath of the plot's discovery, the people of England celebrated the king's survival with bonfires, and this tradition evolved into Guy Fawkes Day. Today, it is a commemoration of the failed plot and the preservation of the king and the government."
